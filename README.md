# google-calendar-minimal-dark

Simple extension that injects a minimal and dark theme CSS into 
Google Calendar. 

It's recommended that you become familiar with keyboard shortcuts to
navigate through the different views. 

There is currently no "toggle" for enabling/disabling the CSS. Maybe it
will be implemented in the future.

(One could also use a style manager, but this seems to incur the least
overhead.)

## installation

1. Go to Extensions (Window -> Extensions) or "chrome://extensions"
2. Check the "Developer Mode" checkbox
3. Click on "Load unpacked extensions..."
4. Select the directory containing this extension and click on "Select"
